Let you change default "WordPress < wordpress@yoursite.com >" e-mail address when sending out e-mails

== Description ==

By default when you send any notification from your blog (including many of the Plugins as well) sender is "WordPress" and the sender e-mail address is <wordpress@yourdomain.com>. I wanted to have personalized sender name and e-mail address that is why I created this Plugin. 

This plugin will enable you to 

* Replace default <wordpress@yourdomain.com> to any e-mail address

* Replace default e-mail from "WordPress" name to anything you want

This plugin is compatible with Contact Form 7 (up to v4.0).
